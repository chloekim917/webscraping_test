# webscraping_test

As you can see, I couldn't meet all the deliverables. I suspect that I should probably use POST or PATCH method to get the url input to the backend to manipulate the url from which I should extract data from but I am out of time and right now, I can't think of a simple way to execute it.
I chose Javascript for frontend because it's the language that I am comfortble with. 
I initially started out the challenge using Node.js for backends but had to switch over to Python with Flask, both of which I have never used before(I am not too familiar with node.js either but I thought I'd be more comfortable with it since I know javascript), because it was hard to find resources that would teach me how to use Selenium in Node.js
I chose Selenium over Puppeteer because it seemed like it was more widely used and easier to find resources that could teach me how to use it.
